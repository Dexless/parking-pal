# Parking Pal

### Description:

Parking Pal is a comprehensive parking application to systematically store information regarding parking at institutions with impacted infrastructure.

### Scrum Cycle 1:

- Home Page
    - Show overview map of parking lots
    - Asset Collection
- Get input request from backend to frontend
    - Set up basic requests using FastAPI
    - Listen for both vite and uvicorn server ports
- Create fabricated data to test.

Notes: Scrum cycle 1 had a good linear progression. Our goals for end to end connection of the API and frontend layer was achievable within the timeframe, each component was developed and works in tandem with one another. Our group could benefit from clearer goals and deliniation of tasks for each user. Next scrum cycle will be heavy on developing the front end and start the building of the database which will allow us to further the fabrication of data via automated means. A more thurough set of goals is to be outlined with every group member.
